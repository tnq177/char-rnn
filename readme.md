Incomplete, bad quality replica of https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow. I'm learning tensorflow.

Learn a Kim Dung (Jin Yong) style char-rnn language model. Look at the sample.txt
for a generated sample from the model trained with ~10 or so novels of Kim Dung
for 30 epochs. Oh man, reading the sample sure is fun :))
